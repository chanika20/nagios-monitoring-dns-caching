# 🚀 Nagios Monitoring & DNS Caching Setup with CentOS & Fedora

This project showcases a hands-on implementation of **Nagios monitoring** and **DNS caching** using a **CentOS server** and **Fedora client machines**. It enhanced my understanding of Linux-based system administration, network monitoring, and DNS performance optimization.

---

## 🔍 Nagios Monitoring Setup

- ✅ Installed Apache web server and Nagios Core on CentOS
- ✅ Configured Nagios with required plugins, scripts, and **NRPE** for client-side monitoring
- ✅ Enabled secure communication using **OpenSSL** and **xinetd**
- ✅ Successfully monitored Fedora clients from the Nagios Web Dashboard

---

## 🌐 DNS Caching Setup

- ✅ Installed and configured a DNS caching server on CentOS
- ✅ Edited `resolve.conf` and created forward & reverse DNS zone files
- ✅ Improved DNS resolution time by optimizing caching mechanisms

## 💡 Skills & Technologies Used

- Linux System Administration (CentOS, Fedora)
- Nagios Core, NRPE, xinetd, OpenSSL
- BIND / DNS server configuration
- Apache Web Server
- DNS zone management and optimization
